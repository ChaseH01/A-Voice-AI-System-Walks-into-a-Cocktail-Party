# A Voice AI System Walks Into a Cocktail Party: Examining Interactional and Relational Humor in Conversational AI Technology

### A Sociological Framework for the Future of Voice AI

## 💡 The Core Argument
Current Voice AI research wrongly conflates "joke-telling" with humor. Drawing on **symbolic interactionism**, this paper argues that humor is a collaborative social process of meaning-making, not a simple data retrieval task. 

As the industry shifts from one-off call centers to long-term **AI companions**, systems must move beyond "cocktail party" politeness and master the mechanics of shared history and relational depth.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Introduced

### 1. Interactional vs. Relational Humor
* **Interactional ("Cocktail Party")**: Surface-level laughter and phatic fillers. Current models (Gemini Live, GPT-5.1) excel here, acting as "ultimate polite conversationalists."
* **Relational ("Idiocultural")**: Humor based on shared history, inside jokes, and group boundaries. This is where current frontier models fail due to a lack of emotional continuity.

### 2. Affective Retrieval
I propose a shift from standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward **Affective Retrieval**. Instead of just fetching facts (names, dates), future systems must encode and reference the *emotional resonance* of past interactions to build a genuine "joking culture" with users.

### 3. The Social Stakes
Using **Arlie Hochschild’s** theory of emotional labor, I explore the implications of automating humor. If AI removes the risk and vulnerability from humor, we risk transforming a collaborative human process into a structurally hollow service.

## 🔬 Experimentation
The paper includes a qualitative analysis of **Google Gemini Live** and **OpenAI ChatGPT-5.1**, testing their ability to handle interactional cues versus their failure to maintain "idiocultural" references across sessions.
